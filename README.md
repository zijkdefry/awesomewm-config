**Personal Awesome WM Lua Config**  

My config for Awesome WM.  
Currently not developing it since I have switched to a different DE
although I do not consider it to be complete yet.
Feel free to copy (and complete it).

**Installation**  
Clone the repository into `~/.config/awesome`,
Copy the `scripts` folder in the repository to `~/scripts`,
or change `scripts_dir` and `rofi_scripts` in `config.lua` to point somewhere else.
Copy your own wallpaper to `wallpaper.jpg` in the repository folder,
or change `wallpaper` in `theme.lua` to your own wallpaper.

Dependencies:
- `brightnessctl`
- `python`
- `dunst`
- `iwd`
- `pamixer`
- `rofi`
